DEPLOY ON DOCKER
Certainly! Here’s a step-by-step guide to deploy your Flask meal planner app as a Docker container on your Raspberry Pi using VS Code:

---

## 1. **Prepare Your Raspberry Pi**

- Make sure your Raspberry Pi is running and connected to your network.
- Update your Pi:
  ```
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  ```
- Install Docker (if not already installed):
  ```
  curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  ```
  *Log out and back in to apply group changes.*

---

## 2. **Copy Your Project to the Pi**

- You can use VS Code’s Remote SSH extension to connect to your Pi, or use `scp` from your PC:
  ```
  scp -r "c:\Users\chris\Documents\Python Scripts\Meal_Plan_App" pi@<raspberry-pi-ip>:~/Meal_Plan_App
  ```
  *(Replace `<raspberry-pi-ip>` with your Pi’s IP address.)*

---

## 3. **Open the Project in VS Code (on the Pi)**

- Use VS Code’s **Remote SSH** extension to open a remote window on your Pi.
- Open the `Meal_Plan_App` folder.

---

## 4. **Build the Docker Image**

- Open the VS Code terminal (on the Pi).
- Run:
  ```
  cd ~/Meal_Plan_App
  docker build -t mealplanapp .
  ```

---

## 5. **Run the Docker Container**

- In the same terminal, run:
  ```
  docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name mealplanapp mealplanapp
  ```
  - This maps port 5000 on your Pi to the container.

---

## 6. **Access the App in Your Browser**

- On any device on your network, open a browser and go to:
  ```
  http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:5000
  ```
  *(Replace `<raspberry-pi-ip>` with your Pi’s IP address.)*

---

## 7. **(Optional) Manage the Container**

- Stop the container:
  ```
  docker stop mealplanapp
  ```
- Start it again:
  ```
  docker start mealplanapp
  ```
- View logs:
  ```
  docker logs mealplanapp
  ```
